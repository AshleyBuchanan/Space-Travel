# Space Travel Assignment

I ended up redoing this assignment three times as I kept running into brick walls with React's limitations.
These limitations were more my lack of understanding, obviously. So I went and learned a few more hooks and 
looked up some examples. Although I am more confident than before, I feel like I should refine my mental
map of React.

I found myself fiddling with the UI for too long. I found myself wanting to prove that I could 'do this'.


## Will Work Further 

I want to implement a spacecraft UPDATE function that works within the paradigm of the API. Perhaps
copy the spaceship and its current location, destroy the original with the API, then make a new
one with the API using the copied data. -> DONE!

I think that I'd like to turn this into a cute idle game or something. Maybe add some population 
growth functions including random disasters on the spaceships and planets. 

Interestingly enough: on Earth, now, with a population of 8 billion-ish, 4 babies are born every second -- and 2 people die -- on average. Could be fun to mess with.

I feel that there should be an indication of the 'building' occurring whilst the api does its thing. Also a 'building complete' indicator.

## Audio

If you allow audio to be played in your browser, I put in a track by Hans Zimmer. Quite a brilliant 
composer. I think I'll use my synths to come up with something more fitting, later, though.
